    </div><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        With IT organizations recognizing the benefits of managed services, growing numbers are handing over the administration, maintenance and enhancements of their enterprise content management solutions to TerraLink thereby benefiting from TerraLink’s extensive OpenText and Microsoft expertise. In response to the ever-increasing needs of our customers, TerraLink has expanded the TerraCare expert services and full-service managed services offerings beyond on-premises, to include the cloud, or a hybrid of the two.
    </p><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        Due to the complex business environment companies face today, IT departments and the user community have neither the training nor the resources to perform day-to-day service requests and maintenance for their ECM systems. These are strategic, line-of-business systems that need expert services to optimize the system availability to the business.
    </p><br /><br />

    <h2 style="padding-left:90px ; color:black">Solution Achieves Payback in Months</h2><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        Stretched - The one adjective that best describes how accounts payable processors and supply chain vendors both feel these days. A total disruption of everyday business in the form of a pandemic has stretched the management and processing of supply chains in ways no one had imagined just a short six months ago.
    </p><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        In the age of this virus crisis, just completing the simplest tasks has taken on new meaning. Uncertainty and business disruptions further challenged with key processors working remotely has contributed to the increased number and frequency of AP email and phone inquiries. These increases are compounding an undesirable inefficiencies trend for both AP processors and supply vendors.
    </p><br /><br />
    <h2 style="padding-left:90px ; color:orange">Employing Bots</h2><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        But what if the AP inquiries can be completed without the emails, phone calls, hold times, and required direct human intervention? What if supply vendors could easily get immediate answers to their repetitive and time consuming questions or make common updates to their customer managed vendor master information? What if AP could provide quick broadcasts on deadlines and policy changes?
    </p><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        Chatbots specifically designed to work with AP processing offer these capabilities and more today. Effortlessly and seamlessly, both the buyers and suppliers benefit from the robotic automation of bots that intelligently provide up to date statuses, answers, updates or policy changes.
    </p><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        A 2018 study by Facebook showed that 56% of people would rather message than call customer service. The use of a frictionless texting interface that is very familiar to vendors makes for quick and strong user adoption.
    </p><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        Chatbots understand natural language with sentiment analysis. They can be designed to comply with strong identity and access management protocols. Chatbots, designed with smart process automation and artificial intelligence, don’t require significant investment in new hardware or software.
    </p><br /><br />
    <h2 style="padding-left:90px ; color:orange">AP Automation</h2><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        Most AP managers and processors have long been tightening the belts and implementing cost controls along with utilizing invoice management technologies. Invoice management applications have been key to automating and streamlining AP processing to achieve cost reductions, improve processing times and optimize cash flows. Supply chain vendors similarly have optimized operations to do more with less as they tightly measure and manage inventories and shipments while increasing collaboration with buyers to best manage working capital.
    </p><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        The leading SAP based invoice processing solution, SAP Invoice Management by OpenText, is well proven for enabling AP productivity gains and supporting better financial decision making. By adding VIM Bots, you can super-charge the SAP Invoice Management application, allowing suppliers to get the AP/procurement policies information they need 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year at a fraction of the cost.
    </p><br /><br />
    <h2 style="padding-left:90px ; color:orange">VIMBots</h2><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        Suppliers can ask questions on the status of invoices they have submitted using natural language via SMS text or web chat. Security controls at each level ensures that the bot will provide invoice information only to a user with proper viewing permissions.

    </p><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        VIMBots can be trained on your procurement process knowledge to answer general questions thus further reducing live calls to your AP department.

    </div><br /><br />
    <h2 style="padding-left:90px ; color:black">Should 2020 be the year your organization rethinks your Enterprise Content Management (ECM) strategy?</h2><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">

        Today's ECM platforms streamline all the aspects of a company’s business knowledge and are the foundation for digital transformation. Effective ECM platforms now enable the seamless creation, distribution and management of transnational, operational, and unstructured content; as well as secure data storage and can ensure regulatory compliance. Employees from different departments can instantly access information that previously was siloed, simultaneously quickening decision-making processes and strengthening customer service.
    </p><br /><br />

    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        Solutions Review reports that up to 15 percent of organizations with limited capability ECM platforms are set to change their existing solution by the end of 2020.
    </p><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        Whether you are taking your first steps towards using an ECM system, or you’re looking to upgrade your current platform to one better suited to your business’s needs, several considerations are key. Taking the time to evaluate what you need can make your goals clear, help you understand the set-up process and lead to successful user adoption of the new system and resulting business processes. Organizationally, work through the checklist below as you push forward with your ECM strategy.
    </p><br /><br />
    <h2 style="padding-left:90px ; color:orange">Why do we need an ECM? What are we hoping to achieve?</h2><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        The enormous functionality of today’s leading ECM systems means there is vast potential to unlock significant organizational efficiencies. Spend some time deciding what exactly you want your ECM to achieve and how it will transform your enterprise’s day-to-day operations. Are you aiming specifically to promote collaborative working? Does your focus lie on protecting crucial business knowledge assets?
    </p><br /><br />
    <h2 style="padding-left:90px ; color:orange">How will we increase user adoption?</h2><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        Like any process of change, successfully implementing a new ECM system requires clear and regular communication to all employees. Take time to explain why the ECM platform is being brought into the organization and demonstrate how it will make everyday tasks quicker and easier. When the implementation is complete, circulate training manuals and consider running in-person training sessions.
    </p><br /><br />
    <h2 style="padding-left:90px ; color:orange">On-premise or cloud?</h2><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        Both options have their advantages. On-premise ECM installations, for example, offer speed, security and control. Cloud implementations, however, can be more cost-effective and the use of multiple servers provides added protection should any individual server fail. A hybrid model, using on-premise infrastructure alongside extra on-demand capacity in the cloud, is another option that is consistently popular.
    </p><br /><br />
    <h2 style="padding-left:90px ; color:orange">What functionalities matter most?</h2><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        While indexing, search, workflow, and secure repository are among the most popular functionalities in most ECM platforms, it’s important to consider exactly what you are looking for. With cost-per-feature billing particularly prevalent in cloud-based products, there is significant opportunity to reduce costs and keep expenditures lean simply by planning and understanding what capabilities you need – and which ones you don’t.
    </p><br /><br />
    <h2 style="padding-left:90px ; color:orange">Does your implementation partner have the right expertise?</h2><br /><br />
    <p style="  padding-left: 90px;padding-right: 100px; font-family: Arial;font-size: 20px">
        Choosing an implementation partner can be a difficult task. You are trusting your partner with the future of your business operations, so it is vital to find a company with a proven track-record and proven experts to guide your project team.
    </p><br /><br />
